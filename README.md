This project is completed by following Rangle.io React training material.

It is a good starting example to learn React fundamentals.

I am grateful to Rangle.io for an amazing React training.

You can fork the project and play around.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
